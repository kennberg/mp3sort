Changes the names of files from something unorganized such as "Band\_Name-Song Title.mp3" to a fixed format such as "Band Name - Song Title.mp3". It works in the current directory and all subdirectories of where the program is executed in. Also, it modifies the m3u play lists in the directory with the new file names.
